## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(readr)
library(tidyr) 
library(stringr)
```

         time_diff = dep_time_mins - sched_dep_time_mins)

# Filter for rows where dep_delay is not NA
flights_filtered <- flights %>% filter(!is.na(dep_delay))

# Create a tibble with the necessary columns

  select(carrier, flight, dep_time_mins, sched_dep_time_mins, time_diff, dep_delay) %>%
  head(5)

# Display the results
print(flights_summary)
