*Importing necessary packages*

```{r cars}

*Counting NA values*

```{r}
names <- c("ID", "DBAName", "AKAName", "License", "FacilityType", "Risk", "Address", 
           "City", "State", "ZIP", "InspectionDate", "InspectionType", "Results", 
           "Violations", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Location")

inspections <- read_csv('http://594442.youcanlearnit.net/inspections.csv',
                        col_names=names, skip=1)

regional_inspections <- unite(inspections, Region, City, State, sep=", ", remove=FALSE)

unique(regional_inspections$Region)

regional_inspections <- regional_inspections %>%
  mutate(Region = str_to_upper(Region))

na_count <- sum(is.na(regional_inspections$Region))

print(paste("The number of NA values in the 'Region' variable is:", na_count))
```

Identifying missing values in a dataset helps prevent reaching incorrect conclusions. Once identified, we can handle these values by either replacing them with other values, such as the mean, or discarding them, depending on our analytical goals.

Additionally, it ensures that data cleaning processes are conducted successfully, as some functions, like 'unite()', can become confused by missing values, potentially leading to unintended data manipulation.

Over here, we are lucky that no 'NA' values are found to exist

```{r}

# 1-1
num2more <- flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay >= 120)
prop2more <- nrow(num2more) / nrow(flights)

num12 <- flights %>% filter(arr_delay >= 60 & arr_delay < 120)
prop12 <- nrow(num12) / nrow(flights)

cat("Proportion of flights with 2+ hours delay:", prop2more, "\n")
cat("Proportion of flights with 1-2 hours delay:", prop12, "\n")

# 1-2

HOUS <- flights %>% filter(dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
ATLA <- flights %>% filter(dest == "ATL")

cat("Number of flights to Houston:", nrow(HOUS), "\n")
cat("Number of flights to Atlanta:", nrow(ATLA), "\n")
cat("Proportion of flights to Houston:", nrow(HOUS) / nrow(flights))
cat("Proportion of flights to Atlanta:", nrow(ATLA) / nrow(flights))

# 1-3

DLATLA <- ATLA %>% filter(carrier == "DL")
propDLATLA <- nrow(DLATLA) / nrow(ATLA)

# 1-7

flights_noon_6pm <- flights %>% filter(dep_time >= 1200 & dep_time <= 1800)

cat("Flights departing between noon and 6 pm:", nrow(flights_noon_6pm))


```

**1-1**
Fewer flights experienced 2+ hours delays with approximately 3.03% than flights delayed for 1-2 hours which takes about 5.38% of total flights.

**1-2**
There were 9,313 flights to Houston, while 17,215 flights flew to Atlanta. Approximately 2.77% of all flights went to Houston, whereas about 5.11% went to Atlanta, indicating Atlanta was a more frequent destination in this dataset.

**1-3**
About 61.41% of the flights to Atlanta were operated by Delta Airlines, because Delta's headquarter is in Atlanta. 40.41% of the flights to Chicago O'Hare were operated by United Airlines, indicating United is a significant, but less dominant, carrier for flights to their companies' headquarter.

**1-7**
There were 9,344 flights that departed between midnight and 6 am, while a much larger number, 121,141 flights, departed between noon and 6 pm.

*5.3.1*

```{r}

# 2 
most_delayed <- flights %>% arrange(desc(arr_delay)) %>% slice(1)
earliest_departure <- flights %>% arrange(dep_delay) %>% slice(1)

cat("Most delayed flight details:")
print(most_delayed)

cat("\nFlight that left most ahead of schedule:\n")
print(earliest_departure)
```
The most delayed flight was operated by flight number HA51 to HNL with an arrival delay of 21 hours and 12 minutes. The departure time was 6:41 with a scheduled arrival time of 15:30, but the actual arrival time was 12:42.

The flight that left most ahead of schedule was operated by flight number B697 to DEN, departing 43 minutes earlier than scheduled. Its departure was recorded at 20:40, and it was originally scheduled to leave at 21:23.

***2***
Nothing happened after 'select()' being called

***3***
'one_of()' select multiple columns based on a variable list, preventing errors if some columns are missing in the data frame.
